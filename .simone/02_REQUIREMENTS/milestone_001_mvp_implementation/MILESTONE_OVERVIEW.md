# Milestone 001: MVP Implementation

## Objective

Build a minimal viable product (MVP) of the FastSCP library that demonstrates core functionality with a focus on performance and correctness.

## Scope

### Included
- Basic SimpleCopyPaste transformation class
- COCO annotation loader with caching
- Test data generation utilities
- Core performance optimizations
- Basic test suite
- Usage examples

### Excluded (Future Milestones)
- Advanced blending modes
- Multi-threaded operations
- PyPI packaging
- Comprehensive documentation
- GPU acceleration

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional**: Successfully loads objects from COCO file and applies copy-paste
2. **Fast**: Achieves < 5ms augmentation time for 512x512 images
3. **Tested**: All core functions have unit tests
4. **Documented**: Basic usage examples work out of the box

## Timeline Estimate

- Core implementation: 2-3 days
- Testing and optimization: 1-2 days
- Documentation and examples: 1 day

Total: ~1 week for MVP

## Technical Approach

1. Start with simple, working implementation
2. Profile and optimize bottlenecks
3. Add tests incrementally
4. Document as we build
