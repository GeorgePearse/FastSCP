# Sprint 001 Completion Summary

**Sprint Name**: Core Implementation
**Completion Date**: 2025-01-13
**Duration**: 1 day

## Accomplishments

### Task 1: Project Setup ✅
- Created Python package structure
- Set up setup.py with dependencies
- Created requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt
- Configured .gitignore for Python projects
- Created all necessary __init__.py files

### Task 2: Test Data Generation ✅
- Implemented TestDataGenerator class
- Created shape generation functions (rectangle, circle, triangle)
- Built COCO annotation builder
- Generated test dataset with 5 images and 24 annotations
- All test data saved to tests/data/

### Task 3: Basic COCO Loader ✅
- Implemented COCOLoader class with pycocotools integration
- Added annotation parsing and metadata organization
- Created object extraction with proper bounds checking
- Implemented LRU cache with configurable size
- Added helper methods for category lookup and counting

### Task 4: SimpleCopyPaste Transform ✅
- Created Albumentations-compatible transform class
- Implemented initialization with COCO file and object counts
- Built apply() method with proper image augmentation
- Added overlay and mix blending modes
- Included scale range and visibility controls

### Task 5: Core Test Suite ✅
- Set up pytest configuration
- Wrote comprehensive tests for all modules
- Achieved 95% code coverage
- Added performance benchmarks
- All 34 tests passing

## Performance Metrics

- Average augmentation time: 0.50ms per 640x480 image
- Test suite execution: ~6 seconds
- Code coverage: 95%

## Key Decisions Made

1. Used pycocotools for COCO format compatibility
2. Implemented simple LRU cache for object reuse
3. Started with basic blending modes (overlay, mix)
4. Focused on correctness over optimization

## Technical Debt / Future Improvements

1. Warning about 'always_apply' parameter in Albumentations
2. Could optimize object pasting with vectorized operations
3. Add more sophisticated blending modes
4. Implement mask-based pasting for better edges

## Lessons Learned

1. NumPy type conversion important for JSON serialization
2. Albumentations parameter passing requires explicit kwargs
3. Test data generation greatly speeds up development

## Ready for Next Sprint

The core implementation is complete and functional. Ready to move to performance optimization and advanced features in the next sprint.
